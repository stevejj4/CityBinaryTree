CityBinaryTree is a Java project that implements a binary tree data structure specifically designed for managing city information,
including city name, country, state, and population. This application allows for adding cities, searching cities by name, 
and listing cities based on a name prefix. The project includes:

A custom binary tree implementation (BTree) following the CityTreeInterface
Recursive methods for efficient search and insertion
Unit tests using JUnit to validate functionality
Comprehensive JavaDocs for all classes and methods
Ideal for learning data structures, algorithms, and Java programming practices.
